# Solving Leet Code

1 at a time

www.leetcode.com

It is a platform on which one can work on their problem solving skills. Data structure and algo questions are present on the same.
They also show which question is asked by which of the major tech companies. Majorly FAANG.

I've been trying to solve the questions on the platform, and pushing code here to help others if they get stuck.

Keep Coding.
